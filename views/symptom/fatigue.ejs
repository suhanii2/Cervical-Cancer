        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Fatigue</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Fatigue is a prevalent and often debilitating symptom experienced by individuals with cervical cancer, impacting their quality of life and daily functioning. Several factors contribute to the development of fatigue in cervical cancer patients, stemming from both the disease itself and its treatment modalities. The presence of anemia, a common complication of cervical cancer characterized by low red blood cell count, reduces oxygen delivery to tissues, leading to feelings of weakness and exhaustion. Additionally, the metabolic changes induced by cancer cells, along with the body's inflammatory response to the disease, can further exacerbate fatigue. Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, also play a significant role in fatigue induction. Chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy can affect healthy cells along with cancer cells, causing systemic fatigue. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Surgical procedures, such as radical hysterectomy, often necessitated in cervical cancer treatment, can result in physical exhaustion during the recovery period. Moreover, the psychosocial impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment, including emotional distress, anxiety, and disrupted sleep patterns, contributes to the overall burden of fatigue. Addressing fatigue in cervical cancer patients requires a multidimensional approach, involving medical interventions, psychological support, and lifestyle modifications. Healthcare providers should prioritize symptom management and provide resources to help patients cope with fatigue, enhancing their overall well-being and treatment outcomes. Encouraging patients to communicate their symptoms openly and advocating for comprehensive supportive care can significantly alleviate the burden of fatigue and improve the quality of life for individuals battling cervical cancer.</p>
